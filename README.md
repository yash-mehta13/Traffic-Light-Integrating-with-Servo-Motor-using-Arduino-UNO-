Designed for a smart traffic management system that simulates real-world traffic control. 

# Weather API-Based Microcontroller Project
This project is a microcontroller-based embedded system that fetches real-time weather data using a Weather API and displays key environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions. It is designed to demonstrate API integration within an embedded C++ application for live environmental monitoring.

## Project Overview
- **Platform**: Arduino-based microcontroller
- **Language**: C++
- **API Used**: OpenWeatherMap API (or similar)
- **Communication**: Wi-Fi module (ESP8266 / ESP32)
- **Application**: Fetches and displays weather data like temperature, humidity, and weather description

## Hardware Requirements
- ESP32 or ESP8266 microcontroller board  
- Wi-Fi connection  
- OLED/LCD Display (optional, for output)  
- USB cable for programming

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE  
- Internet connection for API calls  
- Weather API key (e.g., from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api))

## API Integration
This project uses an HTTP GET request to access weather data from the API. Here's how it's implemented:

- Connects the microcontroller to the internet using Wi-Fi
- Constructs a URL using the API key and city/location
- Sends an HTTP GET request
- Parses the JSON response to extract:
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Weather Description (e.g., "clear sky")
